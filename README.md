# File-Processing-Program
 Course requirements.
 
 A simple console application that is written in C that manages student records. It includes functions to create, open, delete, and rename files for storing student data.

# Note
 I use Sublime Text 3 as a text editor and used the mingw gcc compiler in the command prompt to compile the program/code.
 
 Please don't add, delete, or edit/change something in the [ !Files ] folder. Doing so will possibly make the program crash or not work properly.
